---
The Weather Information Management System, [WIMS](https://nap.nwcg.gov/NAP/#moduleID=NESSHomeModule), is used by the Emergency Command System to pull and announce over the radio the daily weather readings. 
For each Remote Automated Weather Station, [RAWS](http://www.raws.dri.edu/), the dispatcher will announce:

		Temperature, Relative Humidity, Ignition Component, Spread Component, Burning Index, and Dispatch Level
		
		
When the dispatch is broadcasted, enter in these valued into the [San Luis Weather Readings and Dispatch Level Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j7tmzQbmVG3_PNVJ2fcHqW1SjABgNY3OMm5ISUpcEww/viewform). If you miss a value you can log into WIMS to pull the value yourself.
